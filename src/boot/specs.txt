cheeseLDR is a single-sector bootloader for a small subset of Multiboot v1 spec.

It does not require any multiboot signature to be present. It loads ELF files directly. The ELF files
should be placed starting on the second sector of the floppy, after the boot sector.

Limitations:
 - Each ELF segment must be more then 64K
 - Segments must be loaded within conventional memory
 - ELF segments headers must fit into first 512B
 - Assumes 1.44 MB floppy

Handoff interface:
 - Multiboot spec-like environment (32-bit PE)
 - All segments setup per Multiboot spec
 - No multiboot information structure passed to kernel
 - Loader jumps the entry point defined in ELF
 - Stack is guaranteed to be setup, esp = 0x7C00
 - 0x7E00 occupied by temporary GDT
